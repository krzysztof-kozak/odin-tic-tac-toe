# odin-tic-tac-toe

This is the second project in the [full stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe) path of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The main goal of this project was to practice:
- module pattern
- factory pattern
- designing modular objects that speak to each other
- dom manipulation

This project uses a 3rd party library to display some cool alerts: [swal](https://sweetalert.js.org/)
